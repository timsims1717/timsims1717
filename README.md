I'm Timothy Sims, a software developer in Wyoming. I work mostly in Go (both work and play), but I enjoy learning new languages and discovering new things.

I'm currently working on [Gem Runner](https://github.com/timsims1717/gemrunner), written in Go using the engine [Go-Pixel](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel).

You can reach me at timsims1717 (at) gmail (dot) com!
