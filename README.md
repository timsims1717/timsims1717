I'm Timothy Sims, a software developer originally from Wyoming. I work mostly in Go (both work and play), but I enjoy learning new languages and discovering new things.

I'm currently working on expanding my [entry into the Ludum Dare 48 jam, DwarfSweeper](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/dwarfsweeper), written in Go using the engine [Pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel).

You can reach me at timsims1717 (at) gmail (dot) com!
